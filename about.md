<p>
    My name is Chris Glass. I work as a software developer, with six years of experience. My current language of choice is C#, however have experience with PHP, Java, and ruby to name a few.

Outside of work, I've been playing guitar for around eight years and play anything from rock to celtic (personal favorite). I also enjoy playing and watching hockey (go Habs go!) and skiing.
